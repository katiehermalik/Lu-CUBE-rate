      "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "A closure is an inner function that has access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function’s scope chain. The closure has access to variables in three scopes; specifically: (1) variable in its own scope, (2) variables in the enclosing function’s scope, and (3) global variables.",
      "hint": "Think of a closure as a function that carries a backpack with it.",

      "question": "What is the difference between 'null' and 'undefined' in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "From the definition, null is an intentional absence of a value. While undefined is a default value for a variable with no value assigned.Javascript defines null as an empty object, hence if you do typeof null it will show 'object'. While undefined is a primitive value. The type of undefined will be 'undefined' itself.",
      "hint": "Both are falsey values, but have different types.",
